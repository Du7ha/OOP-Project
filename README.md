#Geometric Object Area & Perimeter Calculator
Using the class named geometric object in your book start a graphical user 
interface project for calculating the area and the perimeter of some 
geometric objects like circle , rectangle , and square.
You have to make your graphical user interface contains the following 
items:
1. Combobox that contains the items you will calculate the area and 
the parameter for them.

object for example if you select a rectangle you have to fill in the 
width and the height of this rectangle also a if you select a circle 
you have to fill in the radius for the circle.
3. A button named calculate and display that will calculate and
